DihybridCross:
    What it will do is print "the number of all cases possible(4^x)", "all the cases possible",
    "Phenotypic Ratio", and "Genotypic Ratio" when the Sperm genotype and Egg genotype are given
     using Additive Model.

//Save alleles in String array(it would be eassier to determine genotype
// and if add all digits in the genotype, we can get the phenotype
